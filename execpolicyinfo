Execution Policy
See disclaimer - NEVER EVER MESS WITH THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING...AND WE DON'T, AND DON'T TRUST US! 
THIS IS ADVICE FROM SOMEONE WHO IS NOT AN EXPERT, AND MAY BE WRONG, BUT IS BASED ON MICROSOFTS OFFICIAL INFORMATION, LIKE THAT CAN BE TRUSTED.
NEVER MESS WITH EXECUTION POLICIES...BUT BE AWARE EVERYONE ELSE ALREADY HAS, AND CREATING A SIGNED SCRIPT IS A LITTLE CLUNKY BUT NOT HARD.
IN FACT WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW (TO SECURE YOUR SCRIPTS)

From Microsoft: 
---
Restricted
The default execution policy for Windows client computers.
Permits individual commands, but does not allow scripts.
Prevents running of all script files, including formatting and configuration files (.ps1xml), module script files (.psm1), and PowerShell profiles (.ps1).
---

So take out from that.
1. This should be default!
2. Allow individual commands (dangerous in itself as they can be used to bypass this)

So let's try this out (on my machine, not yours) and never ever use "Set" commands:

PS C:\Users\MxSxC1> Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
Undefined

PS C:\Users\MxSxC1> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine       Undefined

So what does "Undefined" mean?
---
Undefined
There is no execution policy set in the current scope.
If the execution policy in all scopes is Undefined, the effective execution policy is Restricted for Windows clients and RemoteSigned for Windows Server.
---

So straight off the bat, I am not using "Restricted" (well I kind of am, but why would I have this option for Windows Server in there? I think not.

So, if I change it to "Restricted" it should make no difference as I'm not running a Windows Server...

PS C:\Users\MxSxC1> Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

Let's see what we break...
