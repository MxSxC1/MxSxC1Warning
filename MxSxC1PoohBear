We have in the past quoted The Art Of War, but...honestly, Winnie The Pooh just sums it up so much better!

"When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is to not let the bees know you’re coming." 

"Don’t underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can’t hear, and not bothering." 

"Before beginning a Hunt, it is wise to ask someone what you are looking for before you begin looking for it."

Please read the warnings, and think, learn, question, be safe. And for the bad guys out there, "legitimate" or not, for those targeting children and gamers...this is about all the warning you'll get. 

The Wolverine has been slumbering, the honey pot is full, and he's tired of doing nothing.

Who watches the watchmen?
